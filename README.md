# DatabaseGUI

This is the GUI I built using Java and Swing for a project that I am working on. It takes questions and answers with a possible photo and stores them in Firebase. 
Then that data can be used on other devices and platform. I plan to build an Android app that will use this data.
I built this as a way to quickly import a large amount of same format data in the database, since I will have to add these by hand.

Here, you can see a screenshot of the GUI.
